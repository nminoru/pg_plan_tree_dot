pg_plan_tree_dot
================

pg_plan_tree_dot is a PostgreSQL extension which visualizes a plan tree using Graphviz.

As you know, the EXPLAIN command displays the execution plan that PostgreSQL's planner/optimizer generates for the supplied statement.
However the result of this command is rough.

pg_plan_tree_dot allows you to generate a .dot file from the given SQL query, and then you convert the ouput .dot file into the plan tree graph using the "dot" command for Graphviz.
